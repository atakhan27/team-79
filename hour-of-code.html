            <h2>Preparation for the Hour of Code</h2>
            <p>To organize our Hour of Code event, we collaborated with <strong>Dunya IB School</strong> to bring the joy of coding to an MYP1 class (5th grade). After careful planning, we coordinated with class mentors, informed parents, and prepared ourselves to make this session engaging and impactful.</p>

            <p>While the event was a success, some challenges were faced along the way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding loops and their effects caused confusion for some students.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple actions into functions was difficult but overcame with guidance.</li>
                <li>Limited time posed a challenge, but teamwork ensured every student received assistance.</li>
            </ul>
